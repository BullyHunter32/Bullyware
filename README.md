# methamphetamine-public

More formally known as Bullyware
This is just a little project of mine. Its a work in progress, it is not finished. There are misising pages and there may be errors 
I dont mind if someone doesn't like it

Instructions:
- Put the materials within `methamphetamine-public/materials` into `garrysmod/materials` so it should be `garrysmod/materials/meth/mascots/`. 
- Put the 'meth' lua folder within `garrysmod/lua` so it should be `garrysmod/lua/meth/core.lua`



To use you run `lua_openscript_cl meth/core.lua` in the console.
Press `0` to open the menu, anticheats may detect you pressing insert. Better safe than sorry :)
