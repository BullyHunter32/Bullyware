# Bullyware

NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE SOURCE CODE FOR METHAMPHETAMINE SOLUTIONS. I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THEM IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM NOR IS THIS STOLEN CODE. THIS USED TO BE A PROJECT OF MINE JUST TO RECREATE METH AS I ADMIRED THEIR INTERFACE AND I WAS INTERESTED IN MAKING A CHEAT SO THERE CAME A METHAMPHETAMINE REMAKE WHICH WAS LATER RENAMED TO 'Bullyware'.

More formally known as Bullyware.
This is just a little project of mine. Its a work in progress, it is not finished. There are missing pages and there may be errors.
I dont mind if someone doesn't like it

> Didn't think that i'd have to mention this but this cheat is not meant to be the best cheat in the world. Yes, it is made in Lua and I am very well aware that this is not made in C++. This was a project made for fun, not for commercial purposes. I couldn't give less of a shit if someone has something against this project I had fun making, but if you insist you want to cry about it, be my guest.

Instructions:
- Put the materials within `methamphetamine-public/materials` into `garrysmod/materials` so it should be `garrysmod/materials/meth/mascots/`. 
- Put the 'meth' lua folder within `garrysmod/lua` so it should be `garrysmod/lua/meth/core.lua`
- Install 'Raleway' font from google :)
    - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?preview.text_type=custom


To use you run `lua_openscript_cl meth/core.lua` in the console.
Press `0` to open the menu, anticheats may detect you pressing insert. Better safe than sorry :)
